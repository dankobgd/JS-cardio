1. ## Add all numbers

   Return a sum of all parameters entered regardless of the amount of numbers - NO ARRAYS
   ex. addAll(2,5,6,7) === 20

   ***

2. ## Sum all primes

   Pass in a number to loop up to and add all of the prime numbers. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself
   ex. sumAllPrimes(10) == 17

   ***

3. ## Seek and destroy

   Remove from the array whatever is in the following arguments. Return the leftover numbers in an array
   ex. seekAndDestroy([2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 'hello'], 2, 6) == [3, 4, 'hello']

   ***

4. ## Sort by height

   Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.
   ex.
   a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]
   sortByHeight(a) == [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190]

   ***

5. ## Missing letters

   Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it. If all letters are present, return undefined
   ex.
   missingLetters("abce") == "d"
   missingLetters("abcdefghjklmno") == "i"
   missingLetters("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") == undefined

   ***

6. ## Even and odd sums

   Take in an array and return an array of the sums of even and odd numbers
   ex.
   evenOddSums([50, 60, 60, 45, 71]) == [170, 116]
